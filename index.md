# Hello World,
My name is *Filippo Rossi*. I write code and [make stuff](https://github.com/Qu4k).

Currently studing CS at the *University of Trento*.

I like to experiment with *new tecnology*, creating things that I then use on
a daily basis. I am active in the open source community and I love bringing people
toghether through technology.

I also love [game development](https://filipporossi.itch.io) and game jams as a collaborative challenge for me and my friends.
